# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of various sorting algorithms. The included algorithms are:

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
├── src
│   ├── com
│   │   └── sorting
│   │       ├── InsertionSort.java
│   │       ├── MergeSort.java
│   │       └── HeapSort.java
│   └── tests
│       ├── com
│       │   └── sorting
│       │       ├── InsertionSortTest.java
│       │       ├── MergeSortTest.java
│       │       └── HeapSortTest.java
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

- The `src` directory contains the Java source code files for the sorting algorithms.
- The `tests` directory contains the test cases for each sorting algorithm.
- The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- The `README.md` file (this file) provides an overview of the repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.

3. Explore the source code files in the `src` directory to understand the implementations of the sorting algorithms.

4. Run the provided test cases in the `tests` directory to verify the correctness of the sorting algorithms.

## Usage

You can utilize the sorting algorithms in your own Java projects by following these steps:

1. Copy the desired sorting algorithm implementation, such as `InsertionSort.java`, `MergeSort.java`, or `HeapSort.java`, into your project.

2. Import the necessary classes and methods from the sorting algorithm implementation.

3. Create an array of elements that you want to sort.

4. Call the sorting algorithm's method, passing the array as a parameter.

5. The array will be sorted in-place, and you can then use the sorted array as needed in your project.
